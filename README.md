# Polymorphism

Simple demonstration of [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) in C++.

The concept is demonstrated using interactive console application that simulates a hospital management system. It is a more complex version of the [Polymorphism repo](https://github.com/Iulian-Stan/Polymorphism).

Running the example with CMake:

1. Create a build folder
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

2. Generate the project
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```

4. Run the generated example
    ```
    > HOSPITAL.exe
    Hospital:

            1 - Staff

            2 - Patients

            3 - Action

            4 - File IO

            5 - About the program

            ESC sau 0 - Quit

    Enter a command index :
